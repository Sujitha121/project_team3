Online Bookstore Catalog
ðŸ“– Overview
The Online Bookstore Catalog is a simple HTML-based webpage that displays a list of books available in a bookstore.
Each book entry includes:

Book cover image

Title

Author

Category

Price

The page is styled with basic CSS for a clean and user-friendly display.

ðŸ›  How It Works
HTML Structure:
The file uses <div> elements with the book class to represent each book.
Each book contains:

An <img> tag for the cover image

An <h2> tag for the title

<p> tags for the author, category, and price

CSS Styling:
The <style> section inside the <head> applies basic formatting:

Background color for the body

Box shadow and rounded corners for book entries

Padding and margins for spacing

Fixed width for book cover images

Static Content:
All book details (title, author, category, and price) are hardcoded in the HTML file.
No backend or database connection is required.

ðŸ’» Usage
Download/Copy the Code:

Save the provided HTML code as index.html.

Add Book Images:

Place all book images (e.g., book1.webp, book2.jpg, etc.) in the same directory as the HTML file.

Open in Browser:

Double-click index.html or open it via your browser.

View the Catalog:

Scroll through the page to browse all books.
